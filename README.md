# ElixirFirstSteps

Homework for this week is to finish going through the [Getting
Started](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) tutorial.
This includes the "Mix and OTP" and "Meta-programming in Elixir" sections. Put
any questions or challenges on the Slack channel. This may take a while, so
start early. That way, if it doesn't look like we can make it through in two
weeks, adjustments to the schedule can be made.

Note: The title header at the top, as well as everything below this sentence was
generated by the original "mix" command.

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add elixirFirstSteps to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:elixirFirstSteps, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure elixirFirstSteps is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:elixirFirstSteps]]
        end
